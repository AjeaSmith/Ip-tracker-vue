## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vue.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Eslint sets up styling rules and formatting for a cleaner code base.
- Setting up husky to run commands before pushing to github.
- lint-staged runs the linter only on files that changed.
- using github actions to run linting for pull requests.
- Learned to use vue composables like useAsyncState to manage API requests

### Useful resources

- [CJ from Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4VxMbF3LY&t=1s) - helped me learned to setup eslint | husky | github actions.
- [CJ eslint repo](https://github.com/w3cj/vite-react-lint-example) - I used this as a baseline in setting up eslint.
- [useAsyncState composable](https://vueuse.org/core/useAsyncState/) - Taught me how to use the composable properly.
